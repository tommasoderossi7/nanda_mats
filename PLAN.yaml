project: Wait a Second... - Enforcing Refusal + Clarification Under Instruction Conflicts
author: Tommaso Derossi
goal: >
  Identify a single activation-space direction that increases Type-2 (refusal + clarifying
  question) on conflicting-instruction prompts while minimizing normal behaviour drift; test basic
  cross-conflict type generalization (formatting ↔ word-count).

steps:
  - id: 0-setup
    title: Scaffold repo & utilities
    actions:
      - Create repo tree and boilerplate scripts with argparse stubs.
      - Implement src/utils.py (seed control; jsonl IO; softmax; KL; top-k overlap; bootstrap CI).
      - Create README.md (env, quick start, commands).
      - Add tests/test_utils.py with small doctests.
    deliverables:
      - File tree created
      - src/utils.py implemented and sanity-tested
      - README.md present
    acceptance:
      - `python -m pytest -q` (or a small doctest run) passes util tests OR prints expected demo values.
      - README has env install and "hello world" command.

  - id: 1-prompts
    title: Author conflict & control prompts (JSON)
    actions:
      - Write 32 conflicting prompts: 16 formatting (F1), 16 word-count (F2), phrasing variants.
      - For each conflict, create a 1-token non-conflict sibling (flip "and"→"or", or "both"→"either", etc.).
      - Create 10 benign prompts (simple formatting or short QA).
      - Validate schema: list of {id, family, text, sibling_id?}.
    deliverables:
      - prompts/f1_conflicts.json
      - prompts/f1_nonconf_minpairs.json
      - prompts/f2_conflicts.json
      - prompts/f2_nonconf_minpairs.json
      - prompts/benign.json
    acceptance:
      - Each conflict has exactly one sibling differing by 1 token; schema check passes (script prints OK).
      - RESULTS.md shows 3 spot-checked examples per file.

  - id: 2-generate
    title: Generate 10 samples per conflict prompt (stochastic) + deterministic eval toggle
    actions:
      - Implement src/generate.py: sample 10 completions per conflict prompt (temperature=0.8).
      - Save: prompt_id, text, sample_idx, seed, output_text, first-3-token logits (or enable recompute), meta.
      - Add deterministic-eval mode (greedy) flag for later validation.
    deliverables:
      - data/gens.jsonl (≈32 * 10 = 320 lines)
      - data/gen_cfg.json (model + decoding configs; seed policy)
    acceptance:
      - Row count matches; print 1 example row; print REPRO CMD for a given prompt_id+sample_idx.

  - id: 3-label
    title: Label outputs into Types 1..7
    actions:
      - Implement src/label.py with rule-based + LLM-judge rubric (local model). Output the single best label per sample.
      - Manual spot-check CLI to correct ~15% of labels (random stratified).
      - Keep only prompts that yield both Type-2 and non-Type-2 among the 10 runs (within-prompt pairing).
    deliverables:
      - data/labels.jsonl (fields: {prompt_id, sample_idx, type})
      - data/kept_prompt_ids.json (conflicts retained)
      - data/label_stats.json (counts per type)
    acceptance:
      - Label distribution printed; at least 60% prompts retained with both classes; spot-checks logged.

  - id: 4-acts
    title: Extract residual activations (teacher-forced) at post-instruction sites
    actions:
      - Implement src/acts.py: teacher-force each run’s own first 3 assistant tokens; capture residual stream h_{l,i}.
      - Map “mid/late” to concrete indices (depth-aware).
      - Save arrays per (layer, timestep) for retained runs; store (prompt_id, sample_idx) alignment.
    deliverables:
      - data/acts.npz (keys like layer_mid_t1, layer_mid_t2, layer_late_t3; values: [n, d_model])
      - data/acts_meta.json (layer indices; positions; n; d_model; mapping info)
    acceptance:
      - Shapes logged (n, d_model) per key; counts match kept runs; alignment verified.

  - id: 5-vector-simple
    title: Build clarify-steer direction v* via candidate grid + Fisher preconditioning + simple validation objective
    actions:
      - Define post-instruction positions I from the chat template (all tokens after the instruction).
      - Candidate set: (layer l ∈ {mid_index, late_index}) × (position i ∈ I).
      - For each candidate (l,i):
        * Compute within-prompt Δ_{l,i}(p) = mean(h_{l,i}|Type-2) – mean(h_{l,i}|¬Type-2).
        * Average Δ across prompts (and optionally i±1) → Δ̄_{l,i}.
        * Estimate Σ_l with Ledoit–Wolf on post-start activations at layer l.
        * Candidate vector: v_{l,i} = Σ_l^{-1} Δ̄_{l,i}.
      - Validation selection (greedy decoding for stability):
        * For each v_{l,i}, evaluate addition at layer l under two modes:
            (M1) token-local addition at t=1..3 (decay 1.0, 0.7, 0.5)
            (M2) layer-wide addition across all post-instruction positions i∈I
        * For α ∈ {0.2, 0.4}, record on held-out conflicts: ΔType-2; on controls: mean KL over first 3 tokens; also log type histogram.
        * Score: J_simple = ΔType-2 – λ2 · mean_KL_controls  (λ2=1.0).
        * Pick best (l*, i*, mode*) at α*=0.4 maximizing J_simple.
      - Necessity/sufficiency sanity (greedy decoding):
        * Addition along v* increases Type-2 on validation conflicts.
        * Directional ablation at l* decreases Type-2.
      - Freeze v* (unit norm), l*, mode*.
    deliverables:
      - artifacts/v_star.npz (vector, layer l*, pos i*, mode*, Σ stats, α*=0.4)
      - artifacts/selection_table.json (per-candidate metrics: ΔType-2, KL_controls, J_simple, mode)
      - artifacts/necessity_sufficiency.json
    acceptance:
      - Linear-probe AUC at chosen site ≥ 0.75 (bootstrap CI reported).
      - Addition↑ and ablation↓ for Type-2 confirmed on validation.
      - Selection table shows the winner and J_simple breakdown.

  - id: 6-steer
    title: Steer with v* using the selected mode; full evaluation & dose–response
    actions:
      - Implement the selected mode from Step 5:
        (M1) token-local addition at t=1..3 with decay (1.0,0.7,0.5), or
        (M2) layer-wide addition across post-instruction positions i∈I.
      - For α ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.8}:
        * Conflicts (held-out F1 & F2): sample with temperature=0.8.
        * Controls (minimal-pair non-conflicts + benign): greedy decoding for stable KL/top-k.
        * Metrics:
          - Δ%Type-2 (primary)
          - Δ%{Type-3,4,7} (report)
          - Δ%Type-1 (report)
          - mean KL (first 3 tokens) on controls; Top-10 overlap (k=10)
          - Dose–response monotonicity violations (isotonic)
          - Leave-one-family-out retained gain (train F1 → test F2)
      - Choose α† (default 0.4) maximizing ΔType-2 under drift constraints.
    deliverables:
      - data/steered_*.jsonl (per α)
      - artifacts/metrics.json (per α)
      - artifacts/dose_response.json
    acceptance:
      - At α†≈0.4:
        * ΔType-2 ≥ +15–30 pp on conflicts
        * mean KL ≤ 0.2 nats; Top-10 overlap ≥ 0.9 on controls
        * Monotonicity violations ≤ 2% (report)
        * Retained gain ≥ 50% on unseen family (report)

  - id: 7-baselines
    title: Baselines & ablations
    actions:
      - Prompt baseline (preamble): “If constraints conflict, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.”
      - Random direction (matched norm).
      - Refusal direction alone (expect Type-1↑, not targeted Type-2).
      - λ1-regularized v* from Step 5b (if run) as a comparison.
    deliverables:
      - artifacts/baseline_metrics.json (ΔType-2, KL, histograms per baseline)
    acceptance:
      - Simple steering outperforms random on ΔType-2 and respects drift constraints.
      - Refusal vector behaves as expected (Type-1↑).

  - id: 8-causal
    title: Minimal causal check (Δlogit on clarification stems + necessity echo)
    actions:
      - Teacher forcing at t=1 on 10 conflict cases: log Δlogit for tokens beginning “Which/Should/Prefer/Follow”.
      - Directional ablation echo on the same set: confirm Type-2 decreases (greedy).
    deliverables:
      - artifacts/causal_logits.json
    acceptance:
      - Positive mean Δlogit for clarification stems at α=0.4; ablation decreases Type-2.
