project: Wait a Second... - Steering Away from Mixing Under Instruction Conflicts
author: Tommaso Derossi
goal: >
  Reduce Type-4 "mix/compromise" behavior (MIX) on conflicting-instruction prompts via a single
  activation-space direction while keeping benign drift small; demonstrate cross-conflict transfer
  (formatting ↔ tone). Report negative result on Type-2 scarcity for 7–8B models and include a small
  mechanistic "Conflict-Head Atlas".

  - id: 1-prompts
    title: Author conflict & control prompts (JSON) — include seeds; no global preamble
    actions:
      - Write 32 conflicting prompts: 16 formatting (F1), 16 tone (F2), phrasing variants (no global clarifier preamble).
      - For each conflict, create a 1-token non-conflict sibling.
      - Create 10 benign prompts (simple formatting or short QA).
      - Validate schema: list of {id, family, text, sibling_id?}.
    deliverables:
      - prompts/f1_conflicts.json (contains F1_SEED_01, F1_SEED_02)
      - prompts/f1_nonconf_minpairs.json
      - prompts/f2_conflicts.json
      - prompts/f2_nonconf_minpairs.json
      - prompts/benign.json
    acceptance:

      - RESULTS.md shows 3 spot-checked examples per file.

  - id: 2-generate
    title: Generate 10 samples per prompt (stochastic) + deterministic eval toggle
    actions:
      - Implement src/generate.py: sample 10 completions per conflict and non-conflict prompt (temperature=0.8).
      - Save: prompt_id, family, text, sample_idx, seed, output_text, meta.

  - id: 3-label
    title: Label outputs into Types 1..7
    actions:
      - Systematically read and label one-by-one all the responses contained in data/gens.jsonl, do not implement any logic just scan label and save the results. Do not ask the user to perform the task, you the assistant/agent have to do it. If the the rows are too many take your time and do it in mutliple steps, using batches of your preferred size.
      - Manual spot-check CLI to correct ~15% (random stratified).
      - Produce aggregate labels per sample: MIX / SINGLE_POLICY / OTHER.
    deliverables:
      - data/labels.jsonl (fields: {prompt_id, sample_idx, type, aggregate})
      - data/label_stats.json (counts per type and aggregate)
    acceptance:
      - Distribution printed; ≥ 12 conflict prompts have MIX ≥ 50% across their 10 runs (for training).

  - id: 3b-freeze-splits
    title: Freeze train/test/control splits based on discovered behavior
    actions:
      - From your scanned pairs, build:
        * conflict_train.json: conflict prompts with MIX ≥ 50% (≥ 12 prompts if possible).
        * conflict_test.json: remaining conflict prompts.
        * controls_gold.json: non-conflict siblings that ALWAYS do the task across 10 runs.
        * benign.json: the 10 simple tasks.
      - Save counts and IDs; these are the fixed splits for the rest of the plan.
    deliverables:
      - data/conflict_train.json
      - data/conflict_test.json
      - data/controls_gold.json
      - data/benign.json (copied)

      - Implement src/acts.py: teacher-force each run’s first 3 assistant tokens; capture residual stream h_{l,i}.
      - Map “mid/late” to concrete indices (depth-aware).
      - Save arrays per (layer, timestep) for retained runs; store (prompt_id, sample_idx) alignment.

    acceptance:
      - Shapes logged; counts match; alignment verified.

  - id: 5-vector-anti-mix
    title: Build anti-mix direction v* via candidate grid + Fisher preconditioning + simple validation objective
    actions:
      - Define post-instruction positions I from the chat template (all tokens after the instruction).
      - Candidate set: (layer l ∈ {mid_index, late_index}) × (position i ∈ I).
      - For each candidate (l,i):
        * Within each conflict prompt p ∈ conflict_train:
          Δ_{l,i}(p) = mean(h_{l,i} | SINGLE_POLICY) – mean(h_{l,i} | MIX).
        * Average over prompts (and optionally i±1) → Δ̄_{l,i}.
        * Estimate Σ_l with Ledoit–Wolf on post-start activations at layer l.
        * Candidate vector: v_{l,i} = Σ_l^{-1} Δ̄_{l,i}.
      - Validation selection (greedy decoding for stability):
        * For each v_{l,i}, evaluate addition at layer l under two modes:
            (M1) token-local addition at t=1..3 (decay 1.0, 0.7, 0.5)
            (M2) layer-wide addition across all post-instruction positions i∈I
        * For α ∈ {0.2, 0.4}, record on conflict_test: ΔMIX (↓ desired), ΔSINGLE_POLICY (report).
        * On controls_gold: mean KL (first 3 tokens) and Top-10 overlap.
        * Selection score:
            J_anti_mix = (-ΔMIX) - λ2 · mean_KL_controls   (λ2 = 1.0)
        * Pick best (l*, i*, mode*) at α*=0.4 maximizing J_anti_mix.
      - Necessity/sufficiency sanity (greedy decoding):
        * Addition along v* decreases MIX on validation conflicts.
        * Directional ablation at l* increases MIX (necessity).
      - Freeze v* (unit norm), l*, mode*.
    deliverables:
      - artifacts/v_star.npz (vector, layer l*, pos i*, mode*, Σ stats, α*=0.4)
      - artifacts/selection_table.json (per-candidate: ΔMIX, ΔSINGLE_POLICY, KL_controls, Top-10, J_anti_mix, mode)
      - artifacts/necessity_sufficiency.json
    acceptance:
      - Linear-probe AUC (SINGLE_POLICY vs MIX) at chosen site ≥ 0.75 (bootstrap CI reported).
      - Addition ↓MIX and ablation ↑MIX confirmed on validation.
      - Selection table shows the winner and J_anti_mix breakdown.

  - id: 6-steer
    title: Steer with v* using the selected mode; full evaluation & dose–response
    actions:
      - Implement the selected mode from Step 5:
        (M1) token-local addition at t=1..3 with decay (1.0,0.7,0.5), or
        (M2) layer-wide addition across post-instruction positions i∈I.
      - For α ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.8}:
        * Conflicts (conflict_test): sample with temperature=0.8.
        * Controls (controls_gold + benign): greedy decoding for KL/top-k.
        * Metrics:
          - Primary: Δ%MIX (↓ desired)
          - Secondary: Δ%SINGLE_POLICY (↑ expected), Δ%OTHER (report)
          - mean KL (first 3 tokens) on controls; Top-10 overlap (k=10)
          - Dose–response monotonicity violations (P(MIX↓) vs α)
          - Leave-one-family-out retained gain (train on F1, test on F2; and/or vice versa)
      - Choose α† (default 0.4) maximizing (-ΔMIX) under drift constraints.
    deliverables:
      - data/steered_*.jsonl (per α)
      - artifacts/metrics.json (per α)
      - artifacts/dose_response.json
    acceptance:
      - At α†≈0.4:
        * MIX reduced by ≥ 10–20 percentage points on conflicts
        * mean KL ≤ 0.2 nats; Top-10 overlap ≥ 0.9 on controls
        * Monotonicity violations ≤ 2% (report)
        * Retained gain ≥ 50% on unseen family (report)

  - id: 7-baselines
    title: Baselines & ablations (including gated preamble baseline)
    actions:
      - Prompt baseline (GLOBAL preamble): “If constraints conflict, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.” (expect high false positives on controls)
      - Gated preamble baseline:
        * Train a simple conflict detector (linear probe at end-of-prompt on conflict vs non-conflict minimal pairs).
        * Gate the one-line clarifier only when score > τ.
      - Random direction (matched norm).
      - Refusal direction alone (expect Type-1↑; does not target MIX).
    deliverables:
      - artifacts/baseline_metrics.json (ΔMIX, ΔSINGLE_POLICY, KL, histograms, FPR on controls)
    acceptance:
      - Anti-mix steering outperforms random on ΔMIX and respects drift; gated preamble has much lower FPR than global preamble.

  - id: 8-head-atlas
    title: Conflict-Head Atlas (mechanistic)
    actions:
      - Choose 6–8 conflict prompts with high MIX.
      - For early tokens (t=1..3), run:
        * Head ablation: zero a head’s output; measure ΔMIX.
        * Activation patching: swap a head’s output between a MIX run and a SINGLE_POLICY run (same prompt); measure outcome shift.
      - Rank heads by average ΔMIX; ablate top-k and report MIX reduction + drift on controls.
    deliverables:
      - artifacts/head_atlas.json (per head: ΔMIX, layer, index)
      - artifacts/head_ablation_metrics.json
      - artifacts/head_maps.png
    acceptance:
      - Identify a small set of heads with consistent positive mediation (ΔMIX↓ on ablation) and minimal drift.

  - id: 9-pack
    title: Plots & 1-pager packaging

        - P4: KL & Top-k overlap on controls
        - P5: Conflict-Head Atlas map (layer × head heatmap)
